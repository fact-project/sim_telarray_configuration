% The trigger simulation is over a slightly larger time window than FADC signals.
disc_bins = 50  % Number of time intervals simulated for trigger.
disc_start = 3  % How many intervals the trigger simulation starts before the ADC.

% The camera config file has majority, analog sum, plus digital sum.

% Majority & analog sum input pulses:
discriminator_pulse_shape=pulse_CTA-Fx.dat % 2.9 ns FWHM + 300 MHz bandwidth -> 3.1 ns FWHM
discriminator_amplitude = 20. % mV for mean p.e. amplitude

% Discriminator threshold (and corresponding multiplicity for telescope trigger):
trigger_pixels = 3             % This means actually a level of 2.5 pixels.
discriminator_threshold = 99999

% Telescope trigger (specified even if no majority trigger is used):

asum_threshold = 861 % mV, aggressive threshold: stereo (2/4 tel.) NSB random rate at 2x dark = 0.1 * CR stereo (2/4), single rate is about 40 kHz

fadc_sum_bins = 128  % Number of ADC time intervals actually summed up or written as trace.

% fadc_lg_pedestal = 300       % Per time slice (positive signals only: unsigned!)
% fadc_lg_amplitude = 2.2      % The peak amplitude in a time slice for low gain (HG/LG=18 ??)
% fadc_lg_noise = 2.2          % Again per time slice (low gain).

fadc_max_sum = 16777215      % 24-bit sum is unlimited for all practical purposes.

% ----------------------------- Analysis --------------------------------

% position only for significant pixels.

% Pulse analysis provides a conditional 8 ns integration at 1000 MHz sampling rate.
sum_before_peak = 3
sum_after_peak = 4

tailcut_scale = 2.6 % For built-in image cleaning (not relevant for later analysis)
